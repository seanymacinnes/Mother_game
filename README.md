# The Mother Game
## About the game
Mother is a card game based off of an autobiography of an African-American girl, named Maya, growing up with her mother, named Vivian, in the 30s and 40s. When Maya was young she hated her mother and didn’t talk to her for several years. But when Maya got older, her relations with her mother improved tremendously. So Mother is designed around the theme of coming together as one after being separated.
## How to play
This is a 4 player game that is played with a red and blue deck of cards.  Both decks are cut in half and each player gets half a deck. The players who have the blue deck will each draw a card and put their card in the middle. There should be two cards face up in the middle. Then all players will draw 4 cards.
## Rules
**Objective: Obtain two red queens and a black queen (Mom & Me & Mom)**
* Each round players will play 2 cards
* Whoever has the highest combined values of the two cards wins the round and takes the other cards that were played by the other players except for the 2 cards in the middle, the winner of that round places the won cards in the bottom of his/her deck unless the card is a queen
* If the player wins a queen from another player, then the player who won keeps the queen face up to the side to keep score. However, if a player already has a black queen as part of his/her score and then wins another black queen, that queen is sent to the bottom of his/her deck.
* If a player draws a queen from his/her deck, he/she can only count that queen as a part of his/her score if the player uses the queen in a round and wins.
* If the two cards played are not higher than the combined value of the cards in the middle then the player only gets to draw 1 card after the round, but if the player’s two cards as a combined value are higher than the cards in the middle then the player gets to draw two cards after the round
* Every 3 rounds, the cards in the middle will be swapped, alternating blue and red cards, so for example, the first cards in the middle are from the blue deck, after 3 rounds the cards are replaced by 2 cards from the red decks.
* On the 3rd round for the cards in the middle, before the cards get swapped, the value of all doubles played are doubled. For example, if two 9’s are played the combined value is 36, not 18. 
* Whoever wins the 3rd round before the cards get swapped, also wins the cards in the middle, if one of the cards in the middle is a queen then the player adds the queen to his/her score
* If during a round, not a single player obtains a combined value higher than the combined value of the 2 middle cards, then those cards are swapped immediately
* If a player runs out of cards then that player may not participate in the next round, however after that round, the player draws 4 cards
* In the event of a tie, spade beats hearts which beats clubs which beats diamonds
